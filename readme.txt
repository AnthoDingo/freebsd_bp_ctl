Notes from russor:

I've downloaded this driver from from https://www.silicom-usa.com/drivercat/bypass-1/
on May 31, 2022, Version 4.0.2 09/03/2021 (zip file on ftp dated Oct 19, 2021)

And changed it to update the timeout/untimeout calls to callout(9) as
timeout was removed from FreeBSD 13.0 and later.

As a side-note, if you've got a PEG4BPI or similar, older card that shows up
with vendor=0x1374, and not just the subvendor set; it might be possible to
adjust the eeprom to show up with Intel vendor and device ids, and then
it'll be much easier to use.  The simplest way I found to do that is not
super simple, but install the card in a system that can do IO-MMU based PCI
passthrough to a VM; run a Linux vm, with the NIC(s) passed through with the
expected Intel vendor and device id, and then you should be able to use
ethtool to adjust the EEPROM.  For my PEG4BPI, the desired vendor is 0x8086,
device 0x105E, and Initialization Control Word 1 (Word 0Ah) needed to be
adjusted, ethtool shows that word as offset 0x14 (low byte) and 0x15 (high
byte); bit zero of the low byte controls whether the device uses the default
vendor and device IDs or the values in the EEPROM; setting that to zero uses
the default values; the device then shows up as a PEG4BPI-SD and you no
longer need to modify this bpmod driver, or the em driver to detect it.

1. Compiling, installing and loading the software.

   Compiling the software:
	# make
		
   Installing the software in the system directory:
	# make install
	
   Loading the driver as a dynamic module:
	# kldload bpmod     
	
Note: 1. To load the driver automatically when the system is booted, please compile 
      and install the software, and, after that, edit /boot/loader.conf, and add   
      the following line:
	 bpmod_load="YES"
      2. Please load network driver before Bypass software loading.
